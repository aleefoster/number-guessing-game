Project Instructions:
Make sure your script runs without errors. Catch exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way.

As a player of the game, I should see a some kind of text header, welcome or game intro message, before or above the menu.

As a player of the game, I should be continuously prompted for a guess until I get it right.

As a player of the game, after an incorrect guess I should be told if my answer is higher or lower than the answer, so that I can narrow down my guesses.

As a player of the game, after the game ends I should be shown my number of attempts at guessing.


Extra Credit Instructions:
As a player of the game, my guess should be within the number range. If my guess is outside the guessing range I should be told to try again.

As a player of the game, after I guess correctly I should be prompted if I would like to play again.

As a player of the game, at the start of each game I should be shown the current high score (least amount of points), so that I know what I am supposed to beat.

The high score only needs to exist for as long as the game/script runs. When a player ends the game and relaunches the script, the high score will be reset again. (you DO NOT have to store the results to persist data between each script run).
